in this project i calculate atmos-land budget and dynamic/therdynamic component in the drought event

you are recommend to read the file in the follow sequence:

1. map.ipynb: this one i showed the spatial prec anomalies in research region. and calculate the total prec in research region each year.
2. evap.ipynb: this one i calculate the total evap in research region each year.
3. flux.ipynb: this one is  for plot moisture flux and divergence in the region, and calculate the moisture flux in and out of the region each year
4. dyna and ther.ipynb: this one is for plot plot dynamic (wind) or therdiynamic (sh) in the region, and qualify.
dyna and ther is for calculate dynamic and therdynamic component in this drought event, and i think this one is the hardest part in this process 
5. wind.ipynb: we analysis the wind ano then found that when pressure level=850 mb the moisture has biggest ano then analysis the wind field 
6. spaticaltempotral_distribution.ipynb: You can ignore this and this is for future research
